1. To add more pre-made presentations make additional collections in the following way in the presentations.json file.

"da2":{
	"name":"DA 2",
	"id":"da2",
	"type":"collection",
	"custom":"da",
	"content":["references", "predefined", "home", "dual_pathway", "doctor_survey"]
}

To identify it as a da or scenario pre-made presentation I've added the custom value which should be set to either "da" or "scenario".
Also make sure that value: id has the same value as the key for the actual collection. in this case "da2" and "da2".

app.slide.da_popup.js
app.slide.scenario_popup.js

The two javascript files above will check through all the da and scenario collections that has been added to the json file and it will add them to a list in those respective popups.
By clicking on any of the listed buttons the specified collection will be loaded.

To have a new menu made work for each collection loaded they need to be added as a possible parameter to the menu module.
It's listed in setup.js:

app.menu.setCollectionList(["play","da1","da2","scenario1","scenario2"]);

So the full presentation collection is play but the others are already pre-defined da's and scenario's.

Also when clicking on my presentations it will open up the "builder chapter" that can be found in the footer of the template.
Here you can access presentations actually built within a run of the presentation saved in localstorage.



2. Indicators

We've added an indication model to show where you are within a flow of a slideshow if there is more than one slide.
only thing needed to make them show up is to have more than one slide added and add the class indicated to every new slide you create.

example:
<article id="dual_pathway" class="slide indicated" data-ag-name="Slide 4">



3. Builder and defaul builder chapters:

There are some additional collections listed in the json-file that can be used to define slideshows that should always be part of any custom-built presentations.
There is also one that defines which slideshows should be added as a choice when building a custom presentation.

"buildchapters":{
	"name":"ACS presentation",
	"type":"collection",
	"content":["cv_risk", "dual_pathway", "doctor_survey"]
},
"defaultbuildchapters":{
	"name":"ACS presentation",
	"type":"collection",
	"content":["references", "predefined", "home"]
},

buildchapters: These are the ones added to choose from when bulding something from within the presentation.
defaultbuildchapters: Are the slideshows listed that will always be added to any presentation that you build yourself within a presentation.
